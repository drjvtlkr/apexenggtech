## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You are currently seeing the dev branch, you are a developer !!

## Deployed on Vercel

Check out our progress [Abhishek Engg Works](https://apexenggtech.vercel.app). We assigned dev branch to this vercel domain, such that the domain [abhishengg](https://abhishengg.com) will only have production approved code. All of this wouldn't have been possibel without [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
